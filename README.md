# Advanced Data Structures
This repository is contained to implementing and exploring various fundamental data structures in C++. The goal is to provide well-documented, efficient, and easy-to-understand implementations for educational and practical purposes.
## Data Structures
- **Suffix Tree**
  - Insertion, and Search operation for substrings
  - Using SingleLinkedList as a base
  - 
- **Dynamic Interval Tree** 
  - Insertion, and search operations 
  - Using Binary Search tree as a base

## Repository Structure
- Each data structure is contained in a separate folder.
- Each folder contains a `README.md` file that describes the data structure, its constraints, and its test cases.
- There is a `Main.cpp` file in each folder that includes the test cases for the data structure.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/AbdelrhmanReda17/Advanced-Data-Structures/
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory.
    ```bash
    cd Advanced-Data-Structures
    ```
3. Open the project in your favorite IDE or text editor.
4. Compile and run the project.
    ```gitexclude
    g++ Main.cpp -o Main
    ./Main
    ```
5. You can modify the test cases in `Main.cpp` according to your needs.
