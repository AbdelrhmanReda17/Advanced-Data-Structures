# Dynamic Interval Tree

This is a compact implementation of a Interval Tree in C++, adhering to specific constraints. The Interval Tree is constructed according to the requirements outlined in the provided specifications. The implementation includes a Search operation for Intervals.

## Folder Structure
- `IntervalTree.cpp`: The main C++ source file containing the implementation of the Interval Tree.
- `IntervalNode.cpp`: The implementation of the Interval Node class.
- `IntervalNode.h`: The header file for the Interval Node class.
- `IntervalTree.h`: The header file for the Interval Tree class.
## Constraints

- The implementation does not use any built-in functions except `<cstdlib>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstring>`, and `<iostream>`.
- No usage of string class, vector, or anything from STL libraries.
- Tree construction time complexity is O(n^2), and space complexity is O(n).
- Search complexity is O(n^2).

## Test Cases
The **IntervalTreeCases()** function in Main.cpp includes **10** test cases, each with at least 3 search patterns. Feel free to modify or add more test cases according to your needs.
